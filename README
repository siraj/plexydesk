Getting PlexyDesk source files:
===============================
You can get PlexyDesk sources via two methods:

METHOD 1:
---------
1. Go to a folder of your choice where you will build PlexyDesk.
   For example /tmp/plexy
2. git clone git@github.com:plexydesk/plexydesk.git
3. cd plexydesk

METHOD 2:
---------
1. Go to a folder of your choice where you will build PlexyDesk.
   For example /tmp/plexy
2. Get the source tarball from our download page - http://www.plexyplanet.org/download#source
3. tar xjvf plexydesk-X.X.X.tar.bz2
   where X.X.X is the version number of PlexyDesk
4. cd plexydesk-X.X.X
   where X.X.X is the version number of PlexyDesk

Both methods will lead you in the sources root folder.
Next continue with building depending on what you are after.

NOTE: Have in mind that the best way to install PlexyDesk is using your distribution
      native package system. PlexyDesk now supports building packages for these
      distributions (see howto do it below):
      - Mandriva
      - openSuSE
      - Fedora
      - PCLinuxOS*
      - Ubuntu
      - Debian and its derivatives

PCLinuxOS support for building its native packages is dropped now (though the code
that supports the rpm build will remain intact). At present PlexyDesk is known to
build and work on the 2011.6 version of pclos.

Building On Linux (debug mode):
===============================
This is valid for all distributions.
From sources root folder do:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:STRING=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=true -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG:STRING="-g -O0"
make
sudo make install



Building On Linux (release mode):
=================================
This is valid for all distributions.
From sources root folder do:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
sudo make install



Building a Debian/Ubuntu package on Linux:
==========================================
This can be done if your distribution is a Debian derivative.
From sources root folder do:

dist/make_dist_deb.sh

and follow the instructions.
When the plexydesk_X.X.X_YYYY.deb is ready you may install it using the deb standard
command:

dpkg -i INSTALLERS/deb/plexydesk_X.X.X_YYYY.deb

NOTE: If some of the dependencies are not satisfied, use your package manager to install
them first and then do the "dpkg -i plexydesk_X.X.X_YYYY.deb" again.



Building an RPM package on Linux:
=================================
This can be done if your distribution is an RPM distribution. Currently PlexyDesk
supports building RPMs for these distributions:
  - Mandriva
  - openSuSE
  - Fedora
  - Ubuntu
  - Debian and its derivatives

If you know for sure that your distribution is an RPM one, but it is not in the above
list, please try this method first and it may work due to the included support
even of unknown RPM distros.

First be sure you have already installed the rpm-build package.
Next from sources root folder do:

dist/make_dist_rpm.sh

and follow the instructions.
When the plexydesk-X.X.X-YYYYYYY.rpm is ready you may install it using the rpm standard
command:

rpm -ivp INSTALLERS/rpm/plexydesk-X.X.X-YYYYYYY.rpm

NOTE: If some of the dependencies are not satisfied, use your package manager to install
them first and then do the "rpm -ivp plexydesk-X.X.X-YYYYYYY.rpm" again.



Building On Windows:
====================
Please follow the instructions on http://www.plexyplanet.org/win_build



Debugging of PlexyDesk
======================
If you need a debug output from PlexyDesk, you have two methods:

METHOD 1:
---------
PlexyDesk if built in Debugging Mode, will create a log file in your temp folder
(depending on your platform) that will be named plexydesk_log_DATE-TIME.txt
You can see the output in this file.

METHOD 2:
---------
You may debug PlexyDesk (only if built in Debugging Mode) by starting it in console
(any platform) and using the environment variable: PLEXYDESK_CONSOLE_DEBUG.
Set it to "enable", "true" or 1 (all are case insensitive). For Windows for example
do it by issuing this command on the command line of your Command prompt:
SET PLEXYDESK_CONSOLE_DEBUG=true
